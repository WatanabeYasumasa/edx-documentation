when they want to get student information in an open response assessment. Course
staff can now enter a studentâ€™s username to `Access Student Information`_.
(TNL-836)

Course staff can now remove inappropriate student responses and exclude them
from peer assessments. For more information see `Removing a student submission`_
from peer grading. (TNL-900)
